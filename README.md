Concepts introduced in this exercise are Splinter and Beautiful Soup, as well as the Mongo DB structureless database. Splinter Browswer can automate browser functions and will be used here to visit several websites. Splinter works in complement with Beautiful Soup. Once splinter visits a site, BS will parse the site's HTML. It is then up to the user to identify the information they need from the HTML based on the HTML tags.
